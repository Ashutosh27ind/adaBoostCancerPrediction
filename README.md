Cancer Prediction using AdaBoost

Explore the breast cancer dataset and try to train the model to predict if the person is having breast cancer or not. We will start off with a weak learner, a decision tree with maximum depth = 2.  

We will then build an adaboost ensemble with 50 trees with a step of 3 and compare the performance with the weak learner.  

Let's get started by loading the libraries.
